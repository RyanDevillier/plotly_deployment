# Overview of Project
As mentioned in the brief description on the uploaded webpage, the goal of this project was to create a dashboard in which users could view the results of a bacterial research study.  This bacterial research study was conducted by a hypothetical company, Improbable Beef, whose goal was to determine if bacterial samples that are found on the human body, particularly the navel, are capable of synthesizing proteins that can be used for the production of meat products, especially beef.  We used a .json file filled with the research participants' data to produce a dashboard containing multiple graphs that display information about the quantity and type of bacteria found in each participants' navel.  To view the desired participants' results, one must simply select that participants' ID number from the drop down menu on the left side of the webpage.  From there, clicking the participants' ID number will generate the interactive graphs that show the results of the study.  The webpage was built using Javascript (Plotly for the interactive graphs), HTML, and CSS.
